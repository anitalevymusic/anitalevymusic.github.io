                            <h3>Teacher - Lauren</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>Born on the Mornington Peninsula, Lauren has been passionate about the voice from a young age. Her career so far has encompassed a broad range of vocal styles and musical genres, including contemporary (i.e., Pop, Rock, RnB etc.), music theatre, jazz, as well as singer-songwriter. Her performing experiences have included both original and cover bands, various vocal groups, backing vocalist work, as well as working as a lead vocalist with the Australian Army Reserve Band. Lauren made her debut at the Melbourne Cabaret Festival in 2018 with a cabaret she co-wrote, co-directed and performed in, titled the ‘Psych and the Psycho.’ Since then, she has performed in various other shows at the Melbourne Cabaret Festival, the Melbourne Fringe Festival, as well as the Adelaide Fringe Festival. Over the last few years, Lauren has also been developing her passion for songwriting and is currently recording her first single, which will be released later on this year.</p>
							
<p>Credentials</p>

<p>Lauren completed her Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Arts degree at Monash University in 2015, specialising in Popular Voice Studies at the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music. After graduating, she went on to complete her Honour’s degree in Music, focusing on the creative process behind songwriting. In addition to her tertiary education, Lauren also received training at the Victorian College of the Arts in the Music Theatre Foundation Program and participated in a two-week contemporary voice workshop at New York University in 2018. With a passion for voice science, Lauren completed level one and two of Estill Voice Training last year and intends to obtain further Estill certification this year.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Lauren loves working with voice students of all different ages and ability levels, from absolute beginners to more advanced singers wanting to improve their skills. She works closely with students to cater lessons to their individual goals and interests, while also incorporating exercises in harmony, improvisation, stage craft and music theory. Lauren strives to create a playful, supportive environment where singers can develop their vocal ability and artistry, as well as their confidence. To assist in developing control of the voice, Lauren applies the principles of Estill Voice Training, which takes a scientific approach to the study of the voice. Learning about voice mechanics provides students with a more in-depth physiological understanding of their voice as an instrument, and also allows them more creative freedom when it comes to expressing themselves as singers and artists. Lauren encourages students to play with their vocal sound and become versatile performers, so they have the choice to explore whatever genres or styles they are drawn to, in a vocally safe and expressive way.</p>

                            <h3>Teacher - Sanika</h3><br>
						  <p>Experience</p>

<p>Sanika was born in India and raised in Australia from the age of 5. She gained her nickname “Sanika Songbird” in Primary School where she performed in a small competition, winning 1st place at the age of only 6. From then on, she gained experience singing and developed a passion for music performance through joining numerous musicals, choirs, ensembles and doing solo performances. She loves all genres, especially RnB/Pop/Latin/Jazz. She teaches students of all ages and levels. </p>
							
<p>Credentials</p>

<p>At Suzanne Cory High School (Selective Entry), she seized the opportunity to participate in 3 musicals. These include Little Shop of Horrors (chorus), Footloose (Main Lead - Rusty) and We Will Rock You (Female Lead - Scara). She has completed VCE Music Performance with a score of “B” for the final performance. Sanika has recently completed a Bachelors of Music (Specialising in Pop Voice) at Monash University where she has developed a passion for songwriting. She has performed for Fringe Melbourne's first-ever all-female line up for contemporary music. She is now working on releasing her original music and is doing the odd gig every so often. She has begun a Bachelors of Music Production and Sound Engineering at JMC. Having previously taught at Cranbourne Music School, she has also gained some experience teaching autistic children and children that struggle with focus.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Her personal philosophy of music teaching is to inspire students to enjoy learning music at their own pace, with their preferred learning style and she encourages musical creativity. She aims to help students achieve a sound understanding of music theory and performance, positively impact their lives and facilitate enjoyable learning experiences. Her personal philosophy embodies her music education values such as passion for music, optimism/positivity, encouragement of musical/artistic creativity and respectful conduct. Her vision is to guide students in an adaptive way with the understanding that all students learn differently. This includes differences in the way they learn, their musical level in theory or performance, preferences in learning style, previous experience learning music (if any) and learning environment.

                            <h3>Teacher - Jonathan</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>With over 20 years of performing experience as a solo singer/songwriter and band leader, Jonathan has played for Weddings, Special Events, and Pubs all over the world, ranging from Los Angeles to Darwin. He is known for his thoughtful lyrics and one-man-band approach to arranging original and popular songs to cover the broadest spectrum of music on the acoustic and electric guitar.</p>

<p>Credentials</p>

<p>Jonathan completed a Bachelor of Music majoring in Music Production and Engineering while at Berklee College of Music, one of the world’s top contemporary music schools. In 2019 Berklee was one of three schools named as “Best Music School in the World” and in 2021 was named one of the top 10 schools in the U.S. by the “Yamaha Institution of Excellence.” While at Berklee Jonathan studied guitar with Tomo Fujita who famously taught John Mayer. He also took Songwriting, Piano, and Arrangement classes. </p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>For songwriting Jonathan’s approach is to equip the writer with practical tools and exercises that build a strong foundation to work from. An example of some tools for songwriting are; song analysis, rhyming schemes, chord tones for melody writing, and many more. Imagination, fun, routine, and the ability to be light-hearted are keys that Jonathan uses to raise up songwriters.</p>
