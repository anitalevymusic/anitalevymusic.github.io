weaknesses, and together they set achievable goals that are tailored to their unique needs

and aspirations.</p>
							
<p>Karina is passionate about helping her students develop confidence, creativity, and self-

expression through singing. She believes that singing is not just about hitting the right

notes, but also about connecting with emotions and communicating them to an audience.</p>

							<p>Experience</p>

<p>Chelsea began singing and performing at age 4. By age 8 she was playing the guitar and writing her own songs. Her very first song lyrics were “I eat ice cream in the morning, while my mum is snoring.” Exploring a range of vocal styles, including pop, folk, musical theatre, RnB, and jazz, she has performed in many musicals, choirs and has even performed in the State Theatre, with a lead in the production “Time to Shine.” Chelsea also kept up her instrumental skills by playing guitar and trombone in a jazz band. Her main passion has always lied in being a singer/songwriter and has formed her own bands for her original music in both Melbourne and Perth. She loves to record and produce her music to share with the world. She has made some wonderful connections and learnt a lot since releasing her music on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.</p>

<p>Credentials</p>

<p>At the fresh age of 18, Chelsea moved to Western Australia to study at the Western Australian Academy of the Performing Arts (WAAPA). She honed in on her vocal, aural, theory, songwriting and performance skills completing a Diploma and Advanced Diploma of Music Industry. She is now refining her vocal knowledge even further, by studying a Bachelor of Speech Pathology at Australian Catholic University.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Chelsea always prioritises a fun and safe environment for students to try new things and feel safe to make a mistake (and learn from it of course). Building confidence as a performer but also building upon self-awareness as a musician is at the core of what Chelsea teaches. She builds students to have their own expression and style and encourages self-accompaniment and songwriting.</p>

In 2019 Berklee was one of three schools named as “Best Music School in the World” and in 2021 was named one of the top 10 schools in the U.S. by the “Yamaha Institution of Excellence.” While at Berklee Jonathan studied guitar with Tomo Fujita who famously taught John Mayer. He also took Songwriting, Piano, and Arrangement classes. </p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>For songwriting Jonathan’s approach is to equip the writer with practical tools and exercises that build a strong foundation to work from. An example of some tools for songwriting are; song analysis, rhyming schemes, chord tones for melody writing, and many more. Imagination, fun, routine, and the ability to be light-hearted are keys that Jonathan uses to raise up songwriters.</p>
