                            <h3>Teacher - Lauren</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>Born on the Mornington Peninsula, Lauren has been passionate about the voice from a young age. Her career so far has encompassed a broad range of vocal styles and musical genres, including contemporary (i.e., Pop, Rock, RnB etc.), music theatre, jazz, as well as singer-songwriter. Her performing experiences have included both original and cover bands, various vocal groups, backing vocalist work, as well as working as a lead vocalist with the Australian Army Reserve Band. Lauren made her debut at the Melbourne Cabaret Festival in 2018 with a cabaret she co-wrote, co-directed and performed in, titled the ‘Psych and the Psycho.’ Since then, she has performed in various other shows at the Melbourne Cabaret Festival, the Melbourne Fringe Festival, as well as the Adelaide Fringe Festival. Over the last few years, Lauren has also been developing her passion for songwriting and is currently recording her first single, which will be released later on this year.</p>
							
<p>Credentials</p>

<p>Lauren completed her Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Arts degree at Monash University in 2015, specialising in Popular Voice Studies at the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music. After graduating, she went on to complete her Honour’s degree in Music, focusing on the creative process behind songwriting. In addition to her tertiary education, Lauren also received training at the Victorian College of the Arts in the Music Theatre Foundation Program and participated in a two-week contemporary voice workshop at New York University in 2018. With a passion for voice science, Lauren completed level one and two of Estill Voice Training last year and intends to obtain further Estill certification this year.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Lauren loves working with voice students of all different ages and ability levels, from absolute beginners to more advanced singers wanting to improve their skills. She works closely with students to cater lessons to their individual goals and interests, while also incorporating exercises in harmony, improvisation, stage craft and music theory. Lauren strives to create a playful, supportive environment where singers can develop their vocal ability and artistry, as well as their confidence. To assist in developing control of the voice, Lauren applies the principles of Estill Voice Training, which takes a scientific approach to the study of the voice. Learning about voice mechanics provides students with a more in-depth physiological understanding of their voice as an instrument, and also allows them more creative freedom when it comes to expressing themselves as singers and artists. Lauren encourages students to play with their vocal sound and become versatile performers, so they have the choice to explore whatever genres or styles they are drawn to, in a vocally safe and expressive way.</p>

                            <h3>Teacher - Matt</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>Matt’s love for singing began at an early age, listening to his parent’s cd collection. He remembers how he felt, comparing it to the movie ‘Billy Elliot’, in which the main character ‘Billy’ says that when he dances, it feels like ‘electricity’. He has been writing his own songs and performing publicly since the age of 15. At age 20 he started receiving singing lessons, and 2 years later formed the original band ‘Diamonds of Neptune’, as the lead vocalist and lyricist. Since then Matt has accumulated over 10 years of knowledge and experience through a variety of teachers, not only in singing but other areas such as performance, songwriting, recording, as well as aural and theory.</p>

<p>As an artist, Matt has been the lyricist and co-writer to over 60 songs, 16 of which have been professionally recorded and released through Spotify and iTunes with the band ‘Diamonds of Neptune. They have gained reviews from Triple J hosts and had interviews and airplay on stations such as Triple J Unearthed, PBS, Syn FM, Joy FM and Triple M. They have also played hundreds of shows, including music festivals and venues such as ‘The Corner Hotel’ and ‘Fed Square’.<br>
During the lockdowns Matt spent his time learning piano and writing songs for his solo Project ‘Whitbourne’, and at the start of 2021 began voice teaching. He has since gained experience working with students of all ages and experience levels.</p>
							
<p>Credentials</p>

<p>In 2019, Matt solidified his musical education by completing a Bachelor’s Degree in Music Performance in voice, from Box Hill Institute. He graduated with a High Distinction average and in his second year, received a nomination for Box Hill Institute’s ‘Student of The Year Award’. Since then, he has also completed the Estill 1 &amp; 2 course to further increase his understanding of the structures and working of the voice. As a vocalist Matt has been lauded by his peers and teachers due to his versatility as a vocalist, capable of singing a wide range of genres such as Pop, Rock, Folk, Jazz, R’n’b, Gospel, Soul, Theatre and Opera.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>As a coach, Matt aims to create a relaxed, compassionate and fun environment
in which to learn, with an approach centred around curiosity and self-
awareness of not only the students voice, but who they are as a person and
artist. Regardless of age or experience Matt encourages his students to direct
their own learning as much as possible, so as to empower them to continue
learning independently throughout their life.</p>

                            <h3>Teacher - Isaac</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>Since he was a child watching Australian Idol, Isaac has always loved singing. With five years of tertiary music education under his belt, Isaac has shaped his passion into a diverse understanding of musicianship. He has plenty of experience in solo and group singing, having taken part in Music Theatre, Gospel, RnB/Soul, Pop, and Jazz vocal ensembles at University.</p>
							
<p>Isaac has a particular passion for music direction, which led him to vocal directing an A Cappella group called “The Mockingbards” for two and a half years. In 2017, the Mockingbards competed in the AUSACA Championships, proceeding all the way to the final round. Isaac has also vocal directed a few Music Productions, namely Lumina Theatre Company’s ‘Legally Blonde’ (2018) and Lightbox Theatre Company’s ‘The Theory of Relativity’ (2019), for which he was nominated for a Lyrebird Award. Isaac is hardly a stranger to the stage however, and has also performed in countless musicals over the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Credentials</p>

<p>Isaac wanted to take the next step in developing his singing skills, and decided to undertake a Bachelor of Music at Monash University. Specialising in Popular Voice, Isaac gained valuable knowledge in vocal anatomy, which he utilises to keep his voice in tip-top condition. Isaac particularly focused on developing his analytical ear for music, priding himself on his feedback skills.</p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>Isaac has an enthusiastic, analytical, and extremely passionate love for music. Isaac’s voice is not only versatile, but also flexible, able to navigate any song he comes across, no matter how high, and has experience teaching children to seniors, men and women of all ages.  Isaac’s Field of expertise when teaching is Pop, Soul, RnB, Music Theatre, Rock and Jazz though has experience teaching all modern contemporary styles.</p>

                            <h3>Teacher - Jonathan</h3>
							<p>Experience</p>

<p>With over 20 years of performing experience as a solo singer/songwriter and band leader, Jonathan has played for Weddings, Special Events, and Pubs all over the world, ranging from Los Angeles to Darwin. He is known for his thoughtful lyrics and one-man-band approach to arranging original and popular songs to cover the broadest spectrum of music on the acoustic and electric guitar.</p>

<p>Credentials</p>

<p>Jonathan completed a Bachelor of Music majoring in Music Production and Engineering while at Berklee College of Music, one of the world’s top contemporary music schools. In 2019 Berklee was one of three schools named as “Best Music School in the World” and in 2021 was named one of the top 10 schools in the U.S. by the “Yamaha Institution of Excellence.” While at Berklee Jonathan studied guitar with Tomo Fujita who famously taught John Mayer. He also took Songwriting, Piano, and Arrangement classes. </p>

<p>Approach</p>

<p>For songwriting Jonathan’s approach is to equip the writer with practical tools and exercises that build a strong foundation to work from. An example of some tools for songwriting are; song analysis, rhyming schemes, chord tones for melody writing, and many more. Imagination, fun, routine, and the ability to be light-hearted are keys that Jonathan uses to raise up songwriters.</p>
